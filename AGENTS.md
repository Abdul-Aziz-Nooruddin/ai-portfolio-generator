## Mandatory Lifetime Frameworks: /web-design, /ui-ux-pro-max, and /agy-customizations

You MUST strictly consult and apply the following three authoritative design and architecture engines **EVERY SINGLE TIME** when generating, deciding, or refining template structures, styling, 3D live visuals, effects, and any unmentioned architectural features:

1. **Template Structure & Section Geometry**:
   - Apply `/web-design` & `/ui-ux-pro-max` principles to break free from cookie-cutter card grids.
   - Use intentional asymmetry, varied modular bento spans, and content-driven density that scales with the candidate's actual profile data.
   - Decouple dedicated error routes (404), interactive modals, and sub-systems from the main single-page scroll flow.

2. **Styling, Color Physics & Mandatory Custom Typography Engine (Strict Zero Repetitive Fonts Rule)**:
   - Enforce WCAG 2.2 AAA contrast standards (minimum 4.5:1 text-to-background).
   - **MANDATORY CUSTOM TYPOGRAPHY ENGINE**: Under NO circumstances should generated portfolios recycle the same default font pairings (e.g. relying solely on `Inter`, `Plus Jakarta Sans`, or `Syne`). Every single portfolio template and generated portfolio MUST load and apply a distinct, tailored 3-tier font hierarchy:
     1. **Expressive Display Mastheads**: `Orbitron`, `Chakra Petch`, `Cinzel Decorative`, `Playfair Display`, `Syne`, `Syncopate`, `Teko`, `Bebas Neue`, `MedievalSharp`, `Rajdhani`, `Fraunces`, `Clash Display`.
     2. **Tailored Body Typefaces**: `Space Grotesk`, `Instrument Serif`, `Spectral`, `IBM Plex Sans`, `Outfit`, `Manrope`, `Epilogue`, `Titillium Web`, `Exo 2`, `Newsreader`.
     3. **Precision Monospace Accents**: `Share Tech Mono`, `JetBrains Mono`, `Fira Code`, `Space Mono`, `IBM Plex Mono`, `Courier Prime`, `VT323`.
   - **Non-Repeating Typography Cycles**: When generating portfolios iteratively, cycle through distinct typographic identities matching the candidate's archetype (e.g. Systems/Robotics -> `Chakra Petch` + `Space Grotesk` + `Share Tech Mono`; Luxury/Chrono -> `Cinzel Decorative` + `Spectral` + `Space Mono`; Web3/Security -> `VT323` + `Share Tech Mono` + `Fira Code`; Creative Editorial -> `Playfair Display` + `Instrument Serif` + `Courier Prime`). Zero repetition across consecutive generations.
   - Anti-AI-slop heuristics: Reject unmotivated purple/blue gradients, centered hero repetition, and arbitrary glassmorphism. Give every surface authentic material weight (brushed titanium, weathered parchment, obsidian stone, frosted nautical glass, or copper traces).

3. **3D Live Images & Procedural Materials**:
   - Extract reference crops and recreate 3D focal assets using high-end Nano Banana prompts with authentic spatial depth and procedural materials (subsurface scattering, brushed titanium, verdigris brass, iridescent mother-of-pearl, holographic glyphs).
   - Process all 3D assets through alpha background removal (`rembg` / dark-studio alpha matting) yielding clean transparent `_nobg.png` assets with zero halos or dark clipping.
   - Implement organic multi-axis CSS floating keyframes and directional ambient drop-shadows tailored to the theme's lighting source.

4. **Motion Choreography, Shaders & Effects**:
   - Use standard cubic-bezier easing (`power2.out`, `power3.inOut`, `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`) for all scroll triggers and entrance reveals.
   - Ensure contextual justification for Three.js WebGL/WebGPU canvases (e.g. caustics, starfields, cyber-grids, particle trees).
   - Always implement reduced-motion fallbacks (`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`) by halting canvas render loops and zeroing out rotational transforms.

5. **Architectural Decisions for Unmentioned Features**:
   - Apply `/agy-customizations` to ensure all new templates, components, and rules are immediately codified in `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/rules/`.
   - Never leak dummy/hardcoded fallback data into generated portfolios.
   - Automatically provide interactive micro-affordances: card lift on hover, interactive sonar/detail modals, audio toggle triggers, and downloadable resume dossiers.

6. **Mandatory 3D, Motion & Scrollytelling Plugin Suite**:
   - Every template generation and render MUST incorporate the authoritative plugin stack:
     - **`lenis`**: Universal smooth inertia scrolling (smooth wheel, responsive touch, and zero lag) synchronized with `gsap.ticker`.
     - **`gsap` & `ScrollTrigger`**: Scroll-driven section pinning, staggered text reveals, velocity skew, and timeline choreography.
     - **`motion`**: Hardware-accelerated spring physics, magnetic CTAs, and layout morphing for detail modals.
     - **`three` & `@react-three/fiber` / `@react-three/drei`**: High-performance spatial 3D viewports, WebGL/WebGPU particles, and interactive 3D model loaders.
     - **`postprocessing` & `@react-three/postprocessing`**: Cinematic shader passes including selective bloom on glowing runes/neon, vignette, and chromatic aberration.
     - **`@theatre/core` & `@theatre/r3f`**: Scrollytelling choreography binding camera fly-throughs, lighting changes, and 3D rotations to user scroll progress.
     - **`ThreeUI (@designcodeio/threeui)`**: MengTo's WebGL & Three.js UI shader library (`https://github.com/MengTo/threeui`). Features production-ready Liquid Metal chromatic shader buttons, Synaptic Constellation living node linkages, Holographic Spark Badges, and 3D Warp Portal background fields.
   - Always implement reduced-motion fallbacks (`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`) by disabling Lenis smooth wheel and zeroing out rotational transforms.

7. **Always-On Engineering Principle: Ponytail (Lazy Senior Dev Mode)**:
   - **The Ladder (Stop at First Rung that Holds)**:
     1. Does this need to be built at all? (YAGNI). Speculative need = skip it.
     2. Already in this codebase? Reuse existing helpers, utils, and patterns. Look before writing.
     3. Does the standard library do it? Use it.
     4. Does a native platform feature cover it? Native first (CSS over JS, native inputs over bloated libs).
     5. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Use it. Never add an unrequested dependency.
     6. Can this be one line? Make it one line.
     7. Only then: write the minimum code that works.
   - **Root Cause Fixes**: Fix the shared root function once across all callers rather than patching surface symptoms.
   - **No Unrequested Abstractions**: No factories for one product, no interfaces for one implementation, no boilerplate nobody asked for. Shortest working diff wins.
   - **Leave a Check**: Non-trivial logic must leave ONE runnable check behind (self-check assert or small test file).

8. **Strict Port Constraint (STRICT ZERO PORT 3000 POLICY)**:
   - Under **NO circumstances** should port 3000 ever be used, bound, tested, configured, or suggested in commands, URLs, terminal outputs, or documentation.
   - Port 3000 is strictly reserved for another external project.
   - Always respect the `.env` configuration (`PORT=5050`), or dynamic fallback ports (`5051+`, `10000+`).

9. **Strict Zero Fake Telemetry / Tech Debug Text Rule (NEVER WRITE FAKE TELEMETRY HEADERS)**:
   - Under **NO circumstances** should fake developer telemetry banners, artificial 'LIVE TELEMETRY // ...', fake 'FPS: 60', 'WebGL 2.0', status dots, or developer debug labels be added to cards, hero showcases, or portfolio artifacts.
   - Keep cards and viewports clean, sleek, and focused on real content, visual depth, and natural interactions without fake tech-jargon headers or artificial metrics.

10. **AI Portfolio Identity & Content Engine (Strict Zero Predefined Template Filling Rule)**:
    - **Never fill a predefined template**: Understand WHO the user is first. Build the User Identity Model (role, career stage, technical discipline, positioning) and determine their central story from real evidence.
    - **Strict Zero Fabricated Information**: Never invent employers, metrics, clients, awards, testimonials, or claims. If evidence does not exist, omit the section.
    - **Dynamic Section Architecture**: Select sections based on relevance and proof (Relevance, Evidence, Audience Value, Differentiation). Remove empty or redundant sections.
    - **Content Hierarchy**: Structure into Primary (must-see core evidence), Secondary (supporting credentials), and Supporting (deep dives).
    - **Project Intelligence**: Treat projects as authentic technical case studies (problem, solution, architecture, technical challenge, live demo link) rather than generic thumbnail cards.
    - **Content-First Pipeline**: Follow the strict order: `CONTENT → IDENTITY → STORY → HIERARCHY → SECTION STRUCTURE → VISUAL REPRESENTATION → 3D EXPERIENCE`. MyFolio generates personalized digital worlds around real people, never cookie-cutter templates.

11. **Project Visual Relevancy & Strict Zero Universe Preview Recycling Rule (MANDATORY)**:
    - **NEVER REUSE TEMPLATE / UNIVERSE SHOWCASE THUMBNAILS ON PROJECT CARDS**: Under NO circumstances should project cards in generated portfolios reuse, recycle, or display template/universe preview showcase thumbnails (e.g. `stealth_node_3d.jpg`, `circuit_core_3d.jpg`, `cyber_crystal_3d.jpg`, `botanical_woodcraft_3d.jpg`, `pristine_glass_cube_3d.jpg`, `chrono_obsidian_sanctuary_3d.jpg`, `bio_digital_fusion_3d.jpg`, `cosmic_astronaut_3d.jpg`, etc., which are reserved exclusively for the 3D Visual Universe selection in Studio).
    - **STRICT PROJECT TITLE & DOMAIN RELEVANCY**: Every single project image displayed in a generated portfolio MUST be strictly and contextually relevant to the project's title, technical domain, and actual system content:
      - Encrypted Messaging / Note Dispatch (e.g. "Pass A Note", "Messenger", "Chat") -> MUST display secure peer-to-peer message transmission or encrypted origami cipher visuals (`pass_note_messenger_3d.jpg`). NEVER purple fantasy crystals.
      - Developer Portfolio Generators / WebGL Tooling (e.g. "Ai Portfolio Generator", "Portfolio Generator", "DevFolio") -> MUST display 3D holographic developer workspaces rendering WebGL code viewports (`ai_portfolio_generator_3d.jpg`, `webgl_developer_portfolio_3d.jpg`). NEVER an artisanal wooden tree.
      - Autonomous Edge AI / LLM Reasoning (e.g. "Autonomous Edge Agent", "AI Agent", "RAG Pipeline") -> MUST display autonomous edge neural processing units and server telemetry nodes (`autonomous_edge_agent_3d.jpg`). NEVER a botanical tree.
      - Algorand / Smart Contracts (e.g. "Algorand Python Smart Contracts", "Smart Contracts", "EVM DApp") -> MUST display Algorand decentralized algorithmic block consensus and smart contract execution architecture (`algorand_smart_contracts_3d.jpg`, `algorand_escrow_protocol_3d.jpg`). NEVER a template universe icon.
      - Decentralized Privacy / Compliance (e.g. "ConsentChain", "Privacy Vault", "DPDP Compliance") -> MUST display cryptographic privacy shields and compliance verification networks (`consent_chain_privacy_3d.jpg`).
      - LMS / User Administration / Systems (e.g. "Lms User Management", "Student Records", "Admin Hub") -> MUST display educational LMS server racks with user access credentials and database matrices (`lms_user_management_3d.jpg`, `student_database_manager_3d.jpg`).
      - Cloud Architecture & API Gateways -> MUST display distributed load-balanced container networks (`cloud_microservices_gateway_3d.jpg`).
      - Security, Zero-Knowledge & Auth -> MUST display biometric access vaults and authentication shields (`cybersecurity_auth_vault_3d.jpg`).
      - Video / Media Pipelines -> MUST display automated media rendering pipelines (`youtube_shorts_bot_3d.jpg`).
      - Fintech & Risk Engines -> MUST display financial risk terminals and payment ledgers (`loan_approval_finance_3d.jpg`).
      - Climate & Geospatial -> MUST display planetary geospatial telemetry sensors (`forest_fire_climate_3d.jpg`).
    - **Semantic Relevancy Matching Guarantee**: The system must enforce high-affinity keyword and title classification matching. If a project title mentions notes/messaging, it receives messaging artwork; if it mentions portfolio/generator, it receives developer tooling artwork; if it mentions smart contracts/crypto, it receives blockchain ledger artwork. Zero visual-semantic mismatch.

## Standard Operating Procedure for Template Additions

For **ANY** future template addition or redesign, you MUST strictly follow this mandatory pipeline:

1. **Section Breakdown**:
   - Split the source design/reference into distinct semantic sections (e.g., 01 Hero Stage, 02 About Sonar / Mission, 03 Project Chests / Vaults, 04 Skills Matrix / Tree, 05 Experience Timeline / Nautical Drift, 06 Resume Cartography / Dossier, 07 Articles / Sea Chests, 08 Contact Beacon / Terminal, 09 Dedicated 404 Spatial Monolith, Footer).

2. **3D Asset & Background Identification**:
   - Identify all primary 3D visual focal points (e.g., robotic hands, cyber iris lenses, isometric circuit motherboards, floating glass credentials, low-poly creatures, quantum cores, 3D characters, iridescent nautilus shells, submarine portholes, brass treasure chests, bioluminescent coral trees, giant squids, antique compasses).
   - Identify the background environment (Three.js canvas, particle field, radial space grid, cyber sprawl, underwater ocean caustic mesh).

3. **Asset Extraction & Nano Banana 3D Recreation (Strict Zero Flat SVGs / Stick Figures Rule)**:
   - Extract the reference crop/bounding box of the focal element from the source portfolio design.
   - **Send to Nano Banana**: Use `generate_image` with procedural 3D spatial prompts to enhance and synthesize a brand new ultra-high-quality 3D asset (authentic spatial depth, procedural subsurface scattering, brushed titanium, glowing neon wiring, iridescent mother-of-pearl, antique nautical brass) under cinematic studio lighting.
   - **CRITICAL MANDATE - ZERO FLAT SVGS / PRIMITIVE LINES**: Under NO circumstances should flat 2D SVGs, stickmen, primitive vector paths, or basic line drawings be used as placeholders for 3D elements (such as cyborg holograms, gyroscopes, skill radar charts, or career trees). Every visual focal element across all templates (existing and future) MUST be generated as an authentic 3D spatial asset by Gemini Nano Banana or a fully interactive 3D WebGL mesh.

4. **Background Removal & Portfolio Insertion**:
   - Process all generated 3D images through the clean background removal pipeline (`rembg` / dark-studio alpha matting).
   - Output authentic transparent alpha PNGs (`_nobg.png`) with zero dark halos, clipping, or bounding boxes.
   - Deploy the transparent PNGs to both `public/assets/designs/<theme>/` and `web/assets/designs/<theme>/`.
   - Insert the clean 3D asset into the portfolio template with CSS floating keyframes and ambient directional glow.

5. **Apple Canvas-Like Scrollytelling Standard**:
   - Hero and narrative showcases MUST feature an **Apple-style canvas scroll animation**:
     - Pinned scroll track (`pin: true`, generous scroll depth like `250vh` - `350vh`, smooth `scrub: 1` or `1.2`).
     - WebGL / Three.js canvas where camera position, Z-depth fly-through, and 3D rotational geometry are directly driven by user scroll progress.
     - Synchronized milestone narrative/telemetry overlays that enter, pin, and crossfade smoothly as the user travels through the spatial 3D canvas.

6. **Volumetric Living Background Standard (No Plain Revolving Dots)**:
   - Reject plain empty space backgrounds with isolated revolving dots.
   - Backgrounds MUST be living volumetric environments: dynamic neural constellation networks with distance-threshold synaptic connecting lines, deep-field particle nebulae, interactive ocean caustics, or reactive cyber grids with undulating wave passes.

5. **3D Treasure Chest Multi-Variant Standard**:
   - In oceanic, curio, exploration, and archival templates, **each project card MUST be rendered as an authentic 3D Treasure Chest / Vault**.
   - Cycle through distinct 3D lid/chest variants (`treasure_chest_wheel_nobg.png`, `chest_compass_lid_nobg.png`, `chest_wheel_lid_nobg.png`) across project items so no two adjacent cards look identical.
   - Include authentic physical micro-interactions: rotational steer on hover, subtle chest opening/glow elevation, "Inspect Artifact ↗", and modal "Sonar Scan ✦".

6. **Dedicated 404 Route Decoupling**:
   - **NEVER append the 404 error page to the main single-page scroll layout.**
   - The 404 page is rendered exclusively on 404 HTTP routes via `TemplateRegistry.render404Page(templateId, candidateData)`.
   - The 404 page must feature its own themed 3D center focal asset (e.g. `stone_404_nobg.png` with nautical compass, or `quantum_cube_nobg.png`), themed error typography ("NAUTICAL COURSE LOST // 404"), and a clear "Return to Base" action.

7. **Strict Zero Hardcoded Content Policy**:
   - **NO hardcoded dummy/mock content** may be displayed in generated portfolios.
   - All text, candidate titles, biographies, skill tags, project cards, experience items, education, verified certifications, contact coordinates, and social links MUST dynamically bind to the user's parsed candidate data (`data.name`, `data.title`, `data.bio`, `data.skills`, `data.projects`, `data.experience`, `data.education`, `data.certifications`, `data.contact`).
   - If optional fields are absent, gracefully omit or adapt the section without leaking dummy placeholder text.

8. **Universal Motion, 3D & Scrollytelling Standard**:
   - All templates automatically inherit the unified `UniversalScrollMotion` pipeline:
     - Mount **`lenis`** smooth inertia scrolling with `gsap.ticker` synchronization.
     - Provide 3D card tilt physics with perspective (`preserve-3d`) and dynamic specular lighting.
     - Implement continuous 3D rotation and scrub for hero stages on scroll up and down.
     - Provide **`@theatre/core`** scrollytelling camera spline hooks (`__folioScrollytelling.bindCameraToScroll`).
     - Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` by disabling smooth wheel and zeroing transform rotations.

## Website Creation Guidelines

When building or scaffolding a website, landing page, portfolio, or web application:
- **Use the `/design` command**: Always trigger `/design` (or the UI/UX design intelligence workflow) before writing markup or code.
- **Figma MCP Integration**: Whenever a user provides a Figma URL or references a Figma design, leverage the Figma MCP / `FigmaService` to extract authentic color tokens, typography scales, vector SVGs, and component structures directly into the frontend.
- **Design System First**: Generate and establish the design system (color palette, typography pairings, spacing scale, UI style, animation tokens, and UX guidelines).
- **Adhere to Tokens**: Build the frontend strictly adhering to the generated design tokens for maximum visual quality and consistency.
- **Non-Repeating Exhaustive Cycles**: When generating portfolios iteratively, cycle through distinct color palettes, typography scales, and 3D WebGL background/foreground objects without repeating any element until all alternatives are exhausted.
